Abstract

Introduction

The data set used for this project spans from 2020 to 2024, combining
data sourced from Kaggle (2020–2023) with 2024 data scraped from job
websites like Monster and Indeed. Additionally, survey responses from
students in the class provided insights into job opportunities of
interest, aiding in data collection. After cleaning, the data set
comprises 12,419 rows and 12 columns, making it a comprehensive resource
for analyzing the job market.

This project examines salary trends over the past four years, focusing
on variations by job category, experience level, and company size. It
also explores how work settings (remote vs. in-person) have evolved,
their correlation with employee residence and salary levels, and general
trends in job availability. By identifying hidden patterns, this
analysis provides valuable insights into the evolving job market.

How do salaries vary by job category across different experience levels?

Introduction: Understanding how salaries differ across job categories
and experience levels provides insights into the value placed on
different roles and the progression of compensation with experience.
This analysis can help identify which roles offer the highest earning
potential and how experience influences salary growth within each
category.

Approach:

Use box plots to visualize the salary distribution across job
categories, segmented by experience level.

Highlight variations in median and spread of salaries for each category.

Analyze patterns to identify high-paying job categories for entry-level,
mid-level, and senior professionals.

Analysis

```{r}
{r} # ensuring the salary is in numeric column 
data$salary_in_usd <- as.numeric(data$salary_in_usd)
```

# Creating the box plot with formatted y-axis

```{r}
p <- ggplot(data, aes(x = job_category, y = salary_in_usd, fill = job_category)) + geom_boxplot() + facet_wrap(~experience_level) + labs( title = "Salary Distribution by Job category and Experience Level", x = "Job category", y = "Salary (USD)" ) + scale_y_continuous(labels = comma) + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)) print(p) ggsave("distplot.png", plot = p, width = 8, height = 6, dpi = 300 )
```

This graph illustrates salary distributions across various job
categories and experience levels, segmented into four groups:
Entry-level, Mid-level, Senior, and Executive. The x-axis represents job
categories, such as "Data Engineering," "Data Science and Research," and
"Machine Learning and AI," while the y-axis shows salaries in USD. Each
boxplot conveys the spread of salaries within a specific job category
and experience level, highlighting the median (middle line),
interquartile range (the box), and outliers (dots beyond the whiskers).
The job categories are color-coded for clarity, and the legend provides
easy identification of each domain.

Entry-level roles tend to have lower salary ranges, with medians
clustering between \$100,000 and \$150,000 across most categories. Some
fields, like "Machine Learning and AI" and "Leadership and Management,"
show slightly higher entry-level salaries, suggesting higher demand or
specialization. As experience progresses to Mid-level and Senior roles,
the salary ranges and medians increase notably. For instance, "Data
Engineering" and "Machine Learning and AI" exhibit substantial growth,
reflecting the importance of these roles in driving business value and
innovation. The variability in salaries also increases at higher
experience levels, as indicated by longer whiskers and more outliers.

Executive roles show the most significant salary ranges, with categories
like "Leadership and Management" and "Machine Learning and AI"
commanding medians close to or exceeding \$300,000. These roles exhibit
the widest variability, with outliers extending beyond \$400,000,
reflecting the diverse factors influencing executive compensation, such
as company size, industry, and location. Job categories like "BI and
Visualization" and "Data Quality and Operations" generally have narrower
salary ranges, indicating more consistency in pay. This visualization
provides insights into how specialization, demand, and experience level
affect earning potential, helping to identify trends and opportunities
in the data and technology sectors.

Which job titles are most commonly associated with executive-level
experience?

Introduction: Identifying the most common job titles at the executive
level can provide insights into the roles typically held by individuals
with significant experience and leadership responsibilities. This
analysis highlights the demand for certain executive roles and helps
identify career paths that commonly lead to these positions.

Approach:

Filter the dataset to include only rows where the experience level is
"Executive."

Count the frequency of each job title to determine the most common
executive-level roles.

Use a horizontal bar chart to visualize the frequency of job titles,
making it easy to identify prominent roles.

Analysis

```{r}
#Filter data for Executive-level experience 

executive_data <- data %>% filter(experience_level == "Executive") %>% count(job_title, name = "Frequency") # Count frequency of each job title
```

# Bar chart for job titles with Executive-level experience

```{r}
p<- ggplot(executive_data, aes(x = reorder(job_title, Frequency), y = Frequency, fill = job_title)) + 
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", show.legend = FALSE) + coord_flip() + # Flip coordinates for easier readability 
  labs( title = "Job Titles Associated with Executive-Level Experience", x = "Job Title", y = "Frequency", fill = "Job Title" ) + 
  theme_minimal() + theme( axis.title.x = element_text(size = 12), axis.title.y = element_text(size = 12), plot.title = element_text(size = 14, face = "bold"), axis.text.x = element_text(size = 10), axis.text.y = element_text(size = 10) ) print(p) ggsave("barplot.png", plot = p, width = 8, height = 6, dpi = 300 )
```

This chart visualizes the frequency of job titles associated with
executive-level experience in a given dataset. The x-axis represents the
frequency count, while the y-axis lists various job titles. Prominent
roles such as "Data Engineer," "Head of Data," and "Data Scientist" are
highlighted at the top with the highest frequencies, indicating that
these positions are most commonly linked with executive experience. The
dominance of technical and leadership-focused roles reflects the demand
for specialized expertise combined with management capabilities in
data-driven fields.

Lower-frequency job titles, such as "AI Scientist," "ETL Engineer," and
"Principal Data Scientist," are also displayed but are less prevalent.
These roles may represent niche positions or areas with fewer
professionals at the executive level. The chart provides insight into
the hierarchical structure of data-related careers and the titles most
frequently occupied by individuals at advanced stages of their careers.
It highlights the increasing importance of data leadership roles in
modern organizations.

What are the trends in salaries over the years?

Introduction: Analyzing trends in salaries over the years reveals how
compensation has evolved and provides insight into economic factors,
industry demands, and inflation adjustments affecting the job market.
Understanding these trends helps identify periods of significant salary
growth or stagnation and offers valuable context for career planning and
policy decisions.

Approach:

Group the dataset by year (work_year) and calculate the average salary
(salary_in_usd) for each year.

Visualize the trends using a line chart, emphasizing yearly changes in
average salaries with points marking the averages.

Analysis

```{r}
# Calculate average salary per year 
average_salary <- data %>% group_by(work_year) %>% summarize(avg_salary = mean(salary_in_usd, na.rm = TRUE))

```

# Create a line chart

```{r}
p<- ggplot(average_salary, aes(x = work_year, y = avg_salary)) + 
  geom_line(color = "blue", size = 1) + geom_point(color = "red", size = 2) + 
  labs( title = "Trends in Average Salaries Over the Years", x = "Year", y = "Average Salary (USD)" ) + 
  theme_minimal() + 
  theme( plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5), axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1) ) 
print(p) 
ggsave("lineplot.png", plot = p, width = 8, height = 6, dpi = 300 )
```

This line chart illustrates the trends in average salaries from 2020 to
2024, showcasing fluctuations over time. The x-axis represents the
years, while the y-axis indicates the average salary in USD. Each data
point, marked with red dots, highlights the precise salary value for a
given year, while the blue line connects these points to reveal the
overall trajectory. In 2020, the average salary started at approximately
\$160,000. However, a sharp decline occurred in 2021, with salaries
dropping to around \$148,000, marking the lowest point in the observed
timeline.

Following this decline, salaries rebounded significantly between 2021
and 2023, peaking again at \$160,000 in 2023, reflecting a sharp
recovery. However, the trend shows another decline in 2024, although it
was less drastic than the drop in 2021. The overall pattern suggests a
fluctuation in average salaries, characterized by an initial decline, a
recovery period, and a slight downturn in the most recent year. These
shifts may reflect broader economic conditions or changes in industry
demand over the years.

What are the salary trends by job category for different company sizes?

Introduction: Analyzing salary trends across job categories and company
sizes provides insights into how organizational scale impacts
compensation. This analysis highlights variations in average salaries
for different job categories and helps identify which roles are more
lucrative in small, medium, or large companies.

Approach:

Group the dataset by job_category and company_size, then calculate the
average salary (salary_in_usd) for each combination.

Use a multi-line chart to represent salary trends, where each line
corresponds to a specific company size and shows how salaries vary by
job category.

Analysis

```{r}
# Aggregate data to calculate average salary by job title and company size
salary_trends <- data %>% group_by(job_category, company_size) %>% summarise(avg_salary = mean(salary_in_usd, na.rm = TRUE))
```

# Create multi-line chart

```{r}
p <- ggplot(salary_trends, aes(x = job_category, y = avg_salary, color = company_size, group = company_size)) + geom_line(size = 1) + geom_point(size = 2) + labs( title = "Salary Trends by Job Category for Different Company Sizes", x = "Job Category", y = "Average Salary (USD)", color = "Company Size" ) + theme_minimal() + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)) print(p) ggsave("multi-lineplot.png", plot = p, width = 8, height = 6, dpi = 300 )
```

This multi-line chart illustrates the trends in average salaries across
various job categories, segmented by company sizes: large (L), medium
(M), and small (S). The x-axis represents the job categories (e.g., BI
and Visualization, Data Analysis, Machine Learning and AI), while the
y-axis shows the corresponding average salary in USD. Each line
represents a company size, with red for large companies, green for
medium-sized companies, and blue for small companies. The chart
demonstrates salary variations depending on job type and company size.

From the chart, large companies (red line) tend to offer the highest
salaries across most job categories, especially for roles such as Data
Architecture and Modeling, and Machine Learning and AI, where salaries
exceed \$175,000. Medium-sized companies (green line) show more
fluctuation, with some roles like Data Engineering and Leadership
offering competitive salaries but significantly lower for Data
Architecture and Modeling. Small companies (blue line) generally offer
lower salaries across all categories, though the trend is more
consistent, with roles like Machine Learning and AI and Data Science
showing noticeable peaks. The data suggests that large organizations
invest more in specialized roles, while smaller companies maintain more
uniform salary ranges across categories.

How does the work setting correlate with employee residence and salary
levels?

Introduction: Understanding the correlation between work settings (e.g.,
remote, hybrid, in-person), employee residence, and salary levels can
reveal how geographic and organizational factors influence compensation.
This analysis highlights patterns such as whether remote work leads to
higher salaries and how employee location impacts earning potential in
different work settings.

Approach:

Group data by work_setting and employee_residence to calculate the
average salary and the number of employees (employee_count) for each
combination.

Use a bubble chart to visualize the relationship, where:

The x-axis represents work setting.

The y-axis shows average salary.

Bubble size indicates employee count, and bubble color represents
employee residence.

Analysis

```{r}
# Aggregate data for the chart 
bubble_data <- data %>% group_by(work_setting, employee_residence) %>% summarise( avg_salary = mean(salary_in_usd, na.rm = TRUE), employee_count = n() )
```

# Create bubble chart

```{r}
p<-ggplot(bubble_data, aes(x = work_setting, y = avg_salary, size = employee_count, color = employee_residence)) + 
  geom_point(alpha = 0.7) + 
  labs( title = "Work Setting Correlation with Employee Residence and Salary Levels", x = "Work Setting", y = "Average Salary (USD)", size = "Employee Count", color = "Employee Residence" ) + 
  theme_minimal() + 
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)) + 
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::comma) print(p) ggsave("bubbleplot.png", plot = p, width = 8, height = 6, dpi = 300 )
```

This bubble chart examines the relationship between work settings,
average salary levels, and employee counts for individuals residing in
the United States. The x-axis categorizes work settings into Hybrid,
In-person, and Remote, while the y-axis represents average salaries in
USD. The size of the bubbles corresponds to the number of employees in
each category, and the chart color distinguishes data for employees in
the United States.

The chart reveals that the In-person work setting has the largest
bubble, indicating the highest number of employees, with an average
salary of approximately \$155,000, the highest among the three
categories. The Hybrid work setting, by contrast, has the smallest
bubble, representing fewer employees and the lowest average salary at
about \$140,000. The Remote work setting falls in between, with a
medium-sized bubble and salaries that are higher than Hybrid but lower
than In-person. These insights suggest that in-person roles tend to
offer higher pay, potentially reflecting employer preferences or the
nature of jobs requiring on-site presence.

How have remote work and in-person work settings evolved over the years?

Introduction: The shift between remote and in-person work settings over
time reflects broader changes in work culture, technology adoption, and
responses to global events. Analyzing the evolution of these trends
helps understand the growing prevalence of remote work and its
implications for employment practices and employee preferences.

Approach:

Group data by year (work_year) and work setting (work_setting) to
calculate the number of employees in each category.

Calculate the proportion of each work setting relative to the total
employees for each year.

Use a stacked area chart to illustrate how the proportions of remote and
in-person work settings have changed over the years.

Analysis

```{r}
{r} # Summarize data to count employees per year and work setting 
summary_data <- data %>% group_by(work_year, work_setting) %>% summarise(count = n(), .groups = "drop") %>% group_by(work_year) %>% mutate(proportion = count / sum(count))
```

# Stacked area chart

```{r}
p<-ggplot(summary_data, aes(x = work_year, y = proportion, fill = work_setting)) + geom_area(alpha = 0.8) + scale_fill_manual(values = c("In-person" = "orange", "Remote" = "skyblue")) + 
  labs( title = "Evolution of Remote and In-person Work Settings Over the Years", x = "Year", y = "Proportion of Work Setting", fill = "Work Setting" ) + scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent) + 
  theme_minimal() + 
  theme( axis.title.x = element_text(size = 12), axis.title.y = element_text(size = 12), plot.title = element_text(size = 14, face = "bold"), legend.title = element_text(size = 12) ) print(p) ggsave("stackedarea-plot.png", plot = p, width = 8, height = 6, dpi = 300 )
```

This graph illustrates the shift in work settings from 2020 to 2024,
with a clear focus on the balance between remote and in-person work.
Initially, in 2020, in-person work was dominant, but as the pandemic
took hold, there was a sharp increase in remote work, peaking around
2021. By 2021, a large proportion of the workforce transitioned to
remote settings, reflecting the global response to COVID-19
restrictions. The graph shows that during this period, remote work
rapidly overtook in-person work, and the trend remained strong through
2022.

However, starting in 2022, the graph indicates a gradual return to
in-person work, as companies began to reopen offices and adapt to new
hybrid work models. By 2024, while remote work still holds a significant
portion, in-person work has steadily increased, reflecting a shift
toward hybrid or fully in-person models in many sectors. The graph
captures the evolving work environment in response to both external
factors like the pandemic and changing workplace preferences, with
remote work declining slightly as in-person work gains ground again.

Discussion and Conclusion

The analysis of job market trends over recent years highlights several
key insights that reflect the evolving nature of work environments and
compensation structures:

Salaries Across Job Categories and Experience LevelsOur findings reveal
significant variations in salaries by job category and experience
levels. While higher experience levels, such as executive positions,
generally command higher salaries, the presence of outliers shows that
mid-level and senior-level positions can occasionally offer salaries
comparable to or even exceeding those in executive roles. This trend may
result from demand for specialized skills in certain job categories or
organizational priorities emphasizing technical expertise over
leadership.

Dominant Job Titles in Executive ExperienceCertain job titles are
predominantly associated with executive-level experience, indicating a
clear hierarchy and specialization within industries. Understanding
these roles can guide individuals aiming to reach senior positions while
helping organizations identify key leadership profiles.

Yearly Trends in SalariesAverage salaries have shown a noticeable trend
over the years, often reflecting economic conditions, demand for
specific skills, and global events influencing the labor market. Despite
general trends, the analysis highlights variability within specific
years, suggesting industry or region-specific factors influencing
salaries.

Impact of Company Size on Salary TrendsLarger companies tend to offer
higher salaries, especially for certain job categories, likely due to
better resources and established pay scales. However, small and
medium-sized companies still provide competitive salaries in specific
domains, demonstrating that company size is not always the sole
determinant of compensation.

Correlations Between Work Setting, Residence, and SalariesThe work
setting, whether remote, hybrid, or in-person, correlates with salary
levels and employee residence. Remote work, for instance, has opened
opportunities for higher salaries independent of geographic constraints,
highlighting the growing acceptance and adoption of distributed
workforces.

Evolution of Remote and In-Person Work SettingsRemote work has gained
prominence in recent years, reflecting shifts in global work culture.
This change likely stems from technological advancements and responses
to external factors like the COVID-19 pandemic. The increasing
proportion of remote work suggests that flexibility has become a
critical factor in modern employment dynamics.

Broader Implications:These findings have broader implications for
employers and job seekers. Employers can use these insights to design
competitive compensation packages and work policies to attract and
retain talent. Meanwhile, job seekers can identify roles, industries,
and settings aligned with their career aspirations and financial goals.

Limitations:While the dataset is extensive, it primarily focuses on the
data science and technology job markets, which may introduce bias in
representing trends across other industries. Additionally, the presence
of significant outliers in the salary data suggests the need for further
refinement or stratification of job categories and experience levels to
avoid skewed interpretations. Future research could also explore
sector-specific data and more nuanced attributes of remote and hybrid
work.

Conclusion:This project demonstrates the power of data analysis in
uncovering patterns and trends in the job market. By understanding how
various factors influence salaries and work preferences, stakeholders
can make informed decisions that benefit both individuals and
organizations. The results also reflect broader trends in the modern
workforce, emphasizing the importance of adaptability and innovation in
navigating the evolving job landscape. Despite limitations, the findings
provide a strong foundation for understanding the dynamics of the job
market in a rapidly changing world.
