Introduction

The data set used for this project spans from 2020 to 2024, combining data sourced from Kaggle (2020â€“2023) with 2024 data scraped from job websites like Monster and Indeed. Additionally, survey responses from students in the class provided insights into job opportunities of interest, aiding in data collection. 

This project examines salary trends over the past four years, focusing on variations by job category, experience level, and company size. It also explores how work settings (remote vs. in-person) have evolved, their correlation with employee residence and salary levels, and general trends in job availability. By identifying hidden patterns, this analysis provides valuable insights into the evolving job market.

The dataset includes information about salaries across different job categories, experience levels, company sizes, and work settings. It contains 50,000 rows and several variables including job title, years of experience, salary, company size, and work setting (remote or in-person).

Questions and Analysis Plan

Question 1: How do salaries vary by job category across different experience levels?

This question will help identify if certain job categories offer significantly higher salaries at different experience levels. We will compare salary distributions for different job categories by grouping the data based on experience level and visualize it using boxplots and bar plots.

Question 2: Which job titles are most commonly associated with executive-level experience?

By focusing on job titles associated with executive-level roles, we aim to uncover patterns related to seniority and compensation. We will filter the dataset for executive-level positions and analyze the most common titles, potentially using frequency counts and word clouds for visualization.

Question 3: What are the trends in salaries over the years?

This question explores how salaries have evolved over time, potentially revealing broader economic trends. We will aggregate salaries by year and visualize the trend using line plots, identifying key periods of salary growth or stagnation.

Question 4: What are the salary trends by job category for different company sizes?

To understand how company size affects salaries within job categories, we will analyze salaries across different company sizes. We will create comparative plots, like boxplots or grouped bar charts, to highlight salary differences across various company sizes for each job category.

Question 5: How does the work setting correlate with employee residence and salary levels?

This question explores whether work settings (remote vs in-person) are correlated with salary and residence location. We will analyze the distribution of salaries by work setting and residence, using scatter plots and boxplots to explore potential patterns.

Question 6: How have remote work and in-person work settings evolved over the years?

With the rise of remote work, understanding how it has affected salaries and job categories over the years is key. We will track changes in the proportion of remote vs in-person jobs over time, correlating it with salary changes, using line graphs and stacked area plots.


External Data (anticipated):

This project is expected to receive the external data through scraping the job websites like indeed monster etc.
